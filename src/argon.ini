; to some part of the table. This attachment is specified by giving the

; followed by the size of the tile, given as the number of columns and rows
; the tile should span.

; Note that coordinates are given in X-Y order.

; This section defines the keybindings.
;
; Although it is not mandatory that you have any keybindings, it is
; mandatory that you have the section header!
;
; That warning might seem silly now, but in a future release there will be a
; socket interface for issuing commands to a running Argon process, so a
; person playing clever tricks might not want any keybindings here.
;
; I don't know what happens if you try to bind the same key twice.
;
; So far, these commands have been implemented (with all-caps indicating
; text that you should replace with something sensible):
;
; focus_dir (up | down | left | right)
; space WORKSPACE
; exec PROGRAM ARG0 ARG1 ...
; seq COMMAND0 ; COMMAND1 ...
; quit
; kill
; next_win
; prev_win
;
; Note that the "seq" command requires the semicolons to be space-delimited,
; and there may be no trailing semicolon. An empty list of commands is legal,
; however. These rules will probably be made more liberal in future releases.

; The other modifier keys are also supported in theory, but currently they

; ignored, but it cannot yet be set from within the configuration file. If
; you want to change it, look for cIgnoreMask.
