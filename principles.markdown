title: Principles

* The layout of tiles on a workspace should not change at runtime.
* Each window should be in a particular tile, whether that window happens to
  be visible or not.
* A window should not move to a different tile except in fulfillment of a
  user's request.

These principles do not exist for their own sake. I have found, over a
period of years, that a system which follows these principles is the best
for me.

All tiling window managers reduce the physical work required compared to
other window managers, but many of them are not suited to me because their
complex schemes for placing and laying out windows automatically are
mentally taxing. I need my window manager to keep all the windows in places
where I expect them to be.

Thus, the goal of Argon is to minimize both the physical and mental work
required by the management of windows.
