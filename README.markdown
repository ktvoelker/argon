Argon
=====

This is Argon, a declarative tiling window manager.

The documentation for Argon has moved to [a real
website](http://ktvoelker.github.com/argon)!

If you'd like to read the documentation offline, the
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) sources can be found
in the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. There is also a Makefile which
will build the HTML documentation.
