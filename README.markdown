KDWM
====

This is Karl's window manager. Its purpose is to do what I want. If you want
what I want, then you might want KDWM.

What do I want?
---------------
* I want a tiling window manager that allows floating windows above the tiles.
* I want to configure my tile layouts once and never change them again.
* I want every window to be in a particular tile (unless it is floating),
whether or not it is the visible window in that tile, and I don't want the
window manager to ever make that window appear in a different tile unless I
manually move the window to that tile.
* I want certain kinds of windows to always be placed in particular tiles.

In summary, I want to minimize the work I have to do, both with the keyboard
and with my mind. For me, minimizing mental work requires maximizing the
predictability of the window manager's behavior.
