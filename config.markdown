title: Configuring Argon
---

By default, Argon looks for a configuration file called `$HOME/argon.ini`,
but you can specify an alternate configuration file as the first command-line
argument.

The high-level structure of the configuration is the
[INI format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).

More on this is coming soon!
