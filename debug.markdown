title: Generating Debugging Output
---

Bug reports are much easier to understand when they include a runtime log
generated by Argon while you reproduce the bug.

To generate the log, build Argon in debugging mode by running these commands
in the directory where you unpacked your download:

    cabal clean
    cabal configure -fdebug
    cabal build

Then, use `dist/build/argon/argon` as your window manager, redirecting
its standard output to a file.
