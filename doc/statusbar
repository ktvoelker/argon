Internal Statusbar Support
==========================

1. Fix Config and World so that if two spaces use the same statusbar, they
   will truly share it (so the updates don't happen twice). Ensure that
   the World contains a mapping from StatusRef to Window.

2. Implement a generic timer system, which is just a module that defines a
   type of priority queues that sort by time in ascending order, and
   provide two access functions: insert and remove, where remove will remove
   all items up to the current time.

3. Implement one specific timer queue in the World, just for statusbar
   updates. The values in this queue will be StatusRefs.

4. Create all the statusbar windows during initialization and populate the
   World with them before going into the event loop.

5. Add all statusbar tiles to the timer queue during initialization before
   entering the event loop.

6. Add a phase to the event loop in which the statusbar timers are removed
   and executed.

7. Implement statusbar timer execution:
   a. Run the command
   b. Calculate the position inside the statusbar window
   c. Calculate the size of the tile inside the statusbar window
   d. Clear the tile
   e. Write the text into the tile

8. Add statusbar support to Config.INI:
   [statusbar foo]
   layout = whatever
   ; a tile defined by the layout
   a = something to execute
   ; the resolution of a (in seconds)
   res a = 15
   ; another tile defined by the layout
   b = something else to execute
   [space bar]
   statusbar = foo
