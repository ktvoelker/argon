Test!

Fix mapRequestHandler to properly size windows in tiles with a span greater
than (1, 1).

Implement keyReleaseHandler to execute defined commands.

Implement buttonPressHandler to set the focus and pass the button press
through.

Finish mapRequestHandler and resizeRequestHandler so that floating windows go
where requested.

Implement specific lift functions for each monad transition that needs to
occur. Implement all of them in terms of liftIO for better efficiency.

Add Commands for entering and leaving the move and resize modes for floating
windows.

Expand the key-handling system to also support handling mouse clicks (with the
same modifier support). It should be possible to bind separately on press and
release, so that the user can either do drag-based move and resize or
two-click move and resize.

Implement user-defined event-handling support.

Write a Config module that reads a file containing a simpler config format.
