High-Priority Bugs
------------------

Floating Functionality (High-Priority)
--------------------------------------
Move and resize modes


Medium Priority
---------------
Add attraction support to INI configuration parser.

Implement CFocusName command

Implement CFocusQuery command

Tabs on tiles showing what windows are present

Implement a timer system.

Implement statusbar support.

Add commands for moving windows.
  This includes moving between floating and a tile, and vice-versa.


Low Priority Features
---------------------
Add support for setting cIgnoreMask from INI config files.

Floating support in focusDir

Improve the handling of errors in the configuration.

When a button press event hits the root window, determine which tile it is
within and focus that tile.

Make an external, socket-based interface for executing Commands.

Implement user-defined event-handling support.

Keep a per-tile history of most-recently-focused windows.

Visually indicate the focus, perhaps by a colored border.

Check for invalid space and tile refs in runCommand.


Low Priority Refactoring
------------------------
Decide whether the Action system is worth keeping. It isn't used consistently,
and a lot of our X11 calls (like mapWindow, et cetera) are fairly simple and
probably don't deserve the overhead of constructing an Action and putting it
in the queue.
  
  A mixture of using Actions and not using them is bad because X11 calls may
  not be carried out in the intended order, since all calls made through
  Actions will happen last. Perhaps, instead of the heavyweight Actions
  system, we should just have a uniform module which abstracts over X11 with
  a direct, simple API?

Move Collection stuff into a separate module re-exported by Types.
  Make the Collection interface into multiple, better interfaces.


Low Priority Bugs and Mysteries
-------------------------------
Do something better with windows that exist when the window manager starts.
  Right now, we attach standard events to them and then forget that they exist.

Figure out why Xnest segfaults when killing it after the WM has quit.

Figure out why xev got an unending stream of zero keypresses.
  Perhaps this has something to do with Xnest?

Add support for expressions in INI config files.
  In expressions, allow variable references to anything in XInfo.
