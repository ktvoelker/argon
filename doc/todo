Once the "CORE FUNCTIONALITY" section has been completed,
an initial release will be made, including:

1. A Cabal package
2. A website
3. A post on bloggish.net
4. User documentation


PROBLEMS
--------
Window contents are not immediately redrawn when Xnest is hidden and then
revealed.


CORE FUNCTIONALITY
------------------
Config.config (as a parser of an external configuration file)

Cabal-based build system (try doing it from scratch, and use ghc --make's
output to determine exactly what package versions to require if it doesn't
seem to work).


FLOATING FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------
mapRequestHandler

resizeRequestHandler

focusDir

Move and resize modes
  Commands for setting what keyboard modifiers active these modes
  Command for setting Drag Mode versus Two-Click Mode

A command for switching between the floating and tiling worlds.
  We will probably end up wanting to have a special "last focused tile"
  that is reserved for a non-floating tile.


LATER DETAILS
-------------
When a button press event hits the root window, determine which tile it is
within and focus that tile.

Decide whether the Action system is worth keeping. It isn't used consistently,
and a lot of our X11 calls (like mapWindow, et cetera) are fairly simple and
probably don't deserve the overhead of constructing an Action and putting it
in the queue.
  
  A mixture of using Actions and not using them is bad because X11 calls may
  not be carried out in the intended order, since all calls made through
  Actions will happen last. Perhaps, instead of the heavyweight Actions
  system, we should just have a uniform module which abstracts over X11 with
  a direct, simple API?

Tabs on tiles showing what windows are present

Make an external, socket-based interface for executing Commands.

Move Collection stuff into a separate module re-exported by Types.

Add Commands for entering and leaving the move and resize modes for floating
windows.

Expand the key-handling system to also support handling mouse clicks (with the
same modifier support). It should be possible to bind separately on press and
release, so that the user can either do drag-based move and resize or
two-click move and resize.

Implement a timer system.

Implement statusbar support.

Implement user-defined event-handling support.

Keep a per-tile history of most-recently-focused windows and allow that
history to be accessed by commands.

Visually indicate the focus, perhaps by a colored border.

Do something better with windows that exist when the window manager starts.
Right now, we attach standard events to them and then forget that they exist.

Check for invalid space and tile refs in runCommand.

Figure out why Xnest segfaults when killing it after the WM has quit.

Figure out why xev got an unending stream of zero keypresses.
  Perhaps this has something to do with Xnest?
