Catch window closing events in order to set the correct new focus.

Figure out how to force redrawing of window contents after Xnest has been
hidden.

Figure out why new windows were not appearing very quickly.
  Perhaps debug mode caused the problem.
  Make debug mode dynamically alterable via a Command.

Make an external, socket-based interface for executing Commands.

Move Collection stuff into a separate module re-exported by Types.

Implement Command.runCommand.

Implement buttonPressHandler to set the focus and pass the button press
through.

Finish mapRequestHandler and resizeRequestHandler so that floating windows go
where requested.

Add Commands for entering and leaving the move and resize modes for floating
windows.

Expand the key-handling system to also support handling mouse clicks (with the
same modifier support). It should be possible to bind separately on press and
release, so that the user can either do drag-based move and resize or
two-click move and resize.

Implement a timer system.

Implement statusbar support.

Implement user-defined event-handling support.

Write a Config module that reads a file containing a simpler config format.
