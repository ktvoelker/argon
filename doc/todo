Once the config is loaded, transform it to use maps instead of lists.

  Rename the existing Config types to have names prefixed with Input.

Implement Attract.attract which determines where to place a new window.

Finish mapRequestHandler, using attract. Note that if attract determines that
the window should be floating, the window's requested size must be
determined.

Implement resizeRequestHandler.

Implement keyReleaseHandler to execute defined commands.

Implement buttonPressHandler to set the focus and pass the button press
through.

Implement specific lift functions for each monad transition that needs to
occur. Implement all of them in terms of liftIO for better efficiency.
