PROBLEMS
========

New windows take a long time to appear.
  Perhaps debug mode causes the problem.

Window contents are not immediately redrawn when Xnest is hidden and then
revealed.


CORE FUNCTIONALITY
==================
Command.runCommand
  CSpace
  CKillWin
buttonPressHandler
Config.config (as a parser of an external configuration file)


FLOATING FUNCTIONALITY
======================
mapRequestHandler
resizeRequestHandler
focusDir
Move and resize modes
  Commands for setting what keyboard modifiers active these modes
  Command for setting Drag Mode versus Two-Click Mode


FEATURES
========

Cabal-based build system (try doing it from scratch, and use ghc --make's
output to determine exactly what package versions to require if it doesn't
seem to work).

Tabs on tiles showing what windows are present

Make an external, socket-based interface for executing Commands.

Move Collection stuff into a separate module re-exported by Types.

Add Commands for entering and leaving the move and resize modes for floating
windows.

Expand the key-handling system to also support handling mouse clicks (with the
same modifier support). It should be possible to bind separately on press and
release, so that the user can either do drag-based move and resize or
two-click move and resize.

Implement a timer system.

Implement statusbar support.

Implement user-defined event-handling support.

Keep a per-tile history of most-recently-focused windows and allow that
history to be accessed by commands.
