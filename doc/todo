High-Priority Features
----------------------
Come up with a new name that doesn't end with "wm".

  Requirements:
  1. Neat sound
  2. Easily spelled
  3. Not too long
  4. Some clever rationale

  Candidates:
  argon (Noble gas => unchanging => declarative)
  xenon (same rationale as argon)

Add attraction support to INI configuration parser.

Add commands to show and hide the floating layer.
  Maintain this state per-workspace.
  CShowFloat
  CHideFloat

Implement user-defined event-handling support.
  under [global], "on ready"
  under [space x], "on enter"

Change the INI config file format to separate layouts from spaces.

  Ensure that tiles in different spaces can have the same name.
    As long as the TileRefs are correctly constructed during config parsing,
    this should be the case.

  Allow a layout to define the default start tile.

  Allow a space to override the default start tile given by its layout.

  The use of a start tile specification in the DEFAULT section will not work
  as might be expected. This is because Data.ConfigFile will apply the
  defaults to both layouts and spaces, so that in this case:
    [DEFAULT]
    start=a
    [layout x]
    start=b
    [space y]
    layout=x
  "space y" will have "start=a", not "start=b".
  However, the use of DEFAULT for this purpose is not likely to be as useful
  as simply a per-layout default, since only spaces with the same layout will
  necessarily have a tile by a particular name to start in. It doesn't
  seem likely that DEFAULT would be useful for anything else, either, so let's
  simply take the use of DEFAULT out of the example config and not encourage
  its use.


Medium Priority
---------------
Implement CFocusName command

Implement CFocusQuery command

Tabs on tiles showing what windows are present

Implement statusbar support.
  This requires a timer system.


Low Priority Bugs
-----------------
The window doesn't move or resize as fast as the mouse is moving in
move/resize mode. This might be caused by debug mode or Xnest.


Low Priority Features
---------------------
Add support for setting cIgnoreMask from INI config files.

Floating support in focusDir

Improve the handling of errors in the configuration.

When a button press event hits the root window, determine which tile it is
within and focus that tile.

Make an external, socket-based interface for executing Commands.

Keep a per-tile history of most-recently-focused windows.

Visually indicate the focus, perhaps by a colored border.

Check for invalid space and tile refs in runCommand.


Low Priority Refactoring
------------------------
Decide whether the Action system is worth keeping. It isn't used consistently,
and a lot of our X11 calls (like mapWindow, et cetera) are fairly simple and
probably don't deserve the overhead of constructing an Action and putting it
in the queue.
  
  A mixture of using Actions and not using them is bad because X11 calls may
  not be carried out in the intended order, since all calls made through
  Actions will happen last. Perhaps, instead of the heavyweight Actions
  system, we should just have a uniform module which abstracts over X11 with
  a direct, simple API?

Move Collection stuff into a separate module re-exported by Types.
  Make the Collection interface into multiple, better interfaces.


Low Priority Bugs and Mysteries
-------------------------------
Do something better with windows that exist when the window manager starts.
  Right now, we attach standard events to them and then forget that they exist.

Figure out why Xnest segfaults when killing it after the WM has quit.

Figure out why xev got an unending stream of zero keypresses.
  Perhaps this has something to do with Xnest?

Add support for expressions in INI config files.
  In expressions, allow variable references to anything in XInfo.
