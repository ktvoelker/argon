Implement resizeRequestHandler and mapRequestHandler
in Event so that new windows go where they are attracted (or to the focus,
by default).

Implement keyReleaseHandler to execute defined commands.

Implement buttonPressHandler to set the focus and pass the button press
through.

Implement specific lift functions for each monad transition that needs to
occur. Implement all of them in terms of liftIO for better efficiency.

Implement user-defined event-handling support.
