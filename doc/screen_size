Support for screen size changes
===============================

Change the X11 monad to be a newtype around a StateT. Allow it to be
parameterized on both the state and result types.

Inside X11, in the event loop, keep a pair of the Config and the X11Info.

Inside X11, during Config generation, keep a pair of the previous Config (as
a Maybe) and the X11Info.

Provide an interface allowing the Config (or Maybe Config) and X11Info to be
read from the X11.

Provide an interface that allows the X11Info to be changed, at which time the
Config is regenerated.

Add a field to the Config which contains a mapping from tile names to tile
names (plus floating as the Nothing tile), where each mapping indicates that
windows should be moved from the key tile (under the previous Config) to the
value tile (under the new Config).
